# Hi, I'm Christian👋🏽

## 🌻👨🏽‍💻🎨🖼️📐📈

I'm a full-stack web developer, formally experienced and educated in data analysis and quantitative research methods. Alongside my analytical foundation, I have an innate passion in design and visual storytelling.

While I prioritize human-centered design, I've developed a penchant for aesthetics that's deeply rooted in my background in illustration. I'm innately curious and continually tinkering with interactive and visual elements of the web.

## 🌱 I'm currently working on...
