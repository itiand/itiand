# Hi, I'm Christian👋🏽

## 🌻👨🏽‍💻🎨🖼️📐📈

I'm a full-stack web developer with a penchant for the aesthetic — rooted in my background in illustration and visual art. I find myself at the crossroads of technology, design, and human interaction.

While I am formally educated and experienced in data analysis and quantitative research methods, I've also developed a passion for design and visual storytelling. I ask way too many questions and am always exploring the interactive and visual elements of the web.

## 🌱 I'm currently working on...

- 🧰 Tech Stack:
