# Hi, I'm Christian👋🏽

I'm a full-stack web developer, formally experienced and educated in data analysis and quantitative research methods. Alongside my analytical foundation, I have an innate passion in design and visual storytelling.

While I prioritize human-centered design, I've developed a penchant for aesthetics that's deeply rooted in my background in illustration and photography. I'm innately curious and continually tinkering with interactive and visual elements of the web.

When I'm not writing code, you can find me bouldering, taking photos, drawing, or biking around the city.
