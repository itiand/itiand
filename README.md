# Hi, I'm Christian👋🏽

## 🌻👨🏽‍💻🎨🖼️📐📈

I'm a full-stack web developer with a penchant for the aesthetic — rooted in my background in illustration and design. My passion lies at the crossroads of technology, design, and human interaction.

Formally educated and experienced in data analysis and quantitative research methods, my artistic inclinations also drive me towards visual storytelling. I ask way too many questions, love to tinker with the interactive and visual elements of the web, and am on a mission to make the digital realm a prettier place. ✨

###🌱 I'm currently working on...

- 🐘 Memory Palace App (ELIFINT) - A React app for crafting Memory Palaces, integrating OpenAI's API for mnemonics, and offering voice-guided tours for immersive learning.
  - 🧰 - Node, Express, HTML, React, SASS, TailwindCSS, OpenAI API, MongoDB
